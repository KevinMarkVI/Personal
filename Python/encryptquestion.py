	# String encoding
		# Write a method named encrypt(str) which takes in a string and returns an array of pairs: each pair contains the next distinct letter in the string, and the number consecutive repeats.
		# 
		# encrypt("aaabbcbbaaa") ==
		#   [["a", 3], ["b", 2], ["c", 1], ["b", 2], ["a", 3]]
		# encrypt("aaaaaaaaaa") == [["a", 10]]
		# encrypt("") == []
		# Be careful! You don't just want the overall count of each letter: encrypt("aaabbcbbaaa") != [["a", 6], ["b", 4], ["c", 1]]. So make sure to count consecutive letters, not their overall count.
		# 
		# Lastly, a common error is to forget to encrypt the last tokens. Make sure that encrypt("aabbcc") == [["a", 2], ["b", 2], ["c", 2]], not [["a", 2], ["b", 2]].
