# # Write a function word_unscrambler that takes two inputs: a scrambled
# # word and a dictionary of real words.  Your program must then output
# # all words that our scrambled word can unscramble to.
# #
# # Hint: To see if a string `s1` is an anagram of `s2`, split both
# # strings into arrays of letters. Sort the two arrays. If they are
# # equal, then they are anagrams.
# #
# # Difficulty: 3/5
